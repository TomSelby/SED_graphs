This repo and the analysis scripts in it are very early work and somewhat unproven. The idea revolves around peak picking refelctions from SED data then forming a graph with edges wighted by vector length. This groah is then used to form an adjacency matrix which are used as a form of diffraction data with reduced dimensions. These are then compared to simulation or (or clustered then compared to simulation) and a phase map formed.
